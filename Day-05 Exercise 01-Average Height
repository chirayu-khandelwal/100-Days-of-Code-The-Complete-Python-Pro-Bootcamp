#1. inputs are been taken and been stored in list
student_heights = input("Input a list of student heights ").split()
#2. for loop is applied and number of items are stored in variable 
for n in range(0, len(student_heights)):
  student_heights[n] = int(student_heights[n])
#3. variables are initiated and for loop are applied to optain sum of heights and number of student
t_height,t_number = 0,0
for height in student_heights:
  t_height += height
print(f"Total heights = {t_height}")
for student in student_heights:
  t_number += 1
print(f"Number of students = {t_number}") 
#4. result is been printed with using round function
avg_h = round(t_height/t_number)
print(avg_h)

#5. See the example at:
