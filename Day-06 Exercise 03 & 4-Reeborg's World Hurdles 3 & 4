#1. Turn Right & Jump functions are defined
def turn_right():
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
#2. Jump function is modified according to the situation using while loop
def jump():
    turn_left()
    while wall_on_right():
        move()
    turn_right()
    move()
    turn_right()
    while front_is_clear():
        move()
    turn_left()
#3. While loop is created to check does bot has reached at goal
while not at_goal():
    if wall_in_front() :
        jump()
    else:
        move()
