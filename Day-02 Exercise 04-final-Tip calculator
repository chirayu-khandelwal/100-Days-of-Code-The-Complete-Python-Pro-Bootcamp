#If the bill was ₹1584.67, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.
#Each person should pay (1584.67 / 5) * 1.12 = ₹354.97
#Round the result to 2 decimal places.

#1. Inputs are taken
print("Welcome to the tip calculator!")
bill = float(input("What was the total bill? : ₹ "))
tip = int(input("How much tip would you like to give? 30, 50, or 150 as in whole number? : "))
people = int(input("How many people to split the bill? : "))
#2. Calculations are done
total_bill = bill + tip
bill_per_person = total_bill / people
final_amount = round(bill_per_person, 2)

message = (f"Each person should pay : ₹ {final_amount}")
#3. Final message is delivered
print(message)
